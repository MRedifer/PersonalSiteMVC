                                <p>I had to make a change in my life due to there being no passion in my work. All I wanted was to do my job well in every position I had held, but that wasn't enough for me.
                                So I chose to turn my hobby into a career and attended Centriqs Full Stack Web Developer course. This was outside of my comfort zone as I was extremely comfortable with hardware
                                and working within software but had never dabbled in code. I came to fall in love with code and the power it gave you to not only really explore your creativity but also make robust
                                applications with all sorts of functionality given I could learn the skills necessary for said functionality.</p>
